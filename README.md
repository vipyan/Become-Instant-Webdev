# Instant Web Dev (Humorous Landing Page)

This project is a fun, tongue-in-cheek example of a web development landing page. It playfully exaggerates common marketing claims and uses a modal to highlight data collection practices in a humorous way.

## Overview

The landing page presents itself as a shortcut to mastering web development, making over-the-top promises about learning to code quickly and landing high-paying jobs.  It leverages a modal window to "collect user data," but with a humorous twist that acknowledges and mocks the often-unclear data tracking and spamming practices of real websites.

## Key Features

*   **Exaggerated Claims:** The main content features exaggerated promises like "Master JavaScript in 3 hours" and "Be a NodeJS Dev by lunchtime," satirizing the fast-track marketing frequently seen in the tech education space.
*   **Subliminal Learning Gag:** The page references a "subliminal learning technique" that supposedly worked for famous figures, adding to the comedic effect.
*   **Modal Window:** A modal window, prompting the user to provide their name and email address, is included.  The modal text humorously admits to tracking and spamming users.
*   **Styling:** The page includes basic styling with custom colors for the list elements and a font from Google Fonts.
*   **Image:** There's an image placeholder for a Bugatti, reinforcing the over-the-top promises of a lucrative career.
*   **Form:** Form with required field
*   **Disabled button:** There is a disabled button in the modal

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** Structure of the landing page and modal.
*   **CSS:** Styling the page and modal.
*   **JavaScript:**   To handle the functionality of the modal (e.g., opening, closing, form submission), although no specific JavaScript code is in the provided file.
*   **Google Fonts:** to import `Roboto` family.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**  If you were to share this on Github, you would instruct users to clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the landing page.
*   `index.css`: CSS file for styling the page.
*   `index.js`: (Expected) JavaScript file for handling modal interactions.
*   `images/`: Directory containing images (e.g., `bugatti.jpg`, `screenshot.png`).

## Potential improvements

*   Add logic in js to handle the form and modal.
*   Add more humor to the landing page.
*   Create a proper image

## Intended Audience

This project is intended as a humorous demonstration of web development concepts, not a serious landing page. It can be used to:

*   Learn basic HTML and CSS.
*   Illustrate the use of modal windows.
*   Explore the creation of humorous web content.
*   Discuss the ethics around data collection.
